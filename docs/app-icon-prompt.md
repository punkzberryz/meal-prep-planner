# App Icon Prompt

Use this prompt to generate the app icon with ChatGPT -> Canva.

## Primary prompt
Create a modern, minimal app icon for a meal prep planner app. The icon should be simple and recognizable at small sizes. Use a clean rounded-square background with a bright, playful gradient (tangerine to sunny yellow). Center a bold, flat illustration of a salad bowl with a fork and spoon: a simple bowl shape, with a fork and spoon parallel and resting above the rim. No text, no letters, no numbers, no photo realism. Use solid shapes with soft shadows, high contrast, and generous negative space. Keep the style friendly, playful, and lightweight. Output as a square (1:1) icon, 1024x1024.

## Alternate prompt (if you want a more abstract mark)
Create a modern, minimal app icon for a meal prep planner. Use a rounded-square background with a bright pastel gradient (mint to lemon cream). Center a simple geometric symbol that reads as a bowl with utensils: a shallow bowl arc, with a fork and spoon parallel above it. No text, no numbers, no photo realism. Flat vector style, subtle shadow, high contrast, clean edges, lots of negative space. Output 1024x1024, square.

## Optional negative prompt
Avoid: text, letters, numbers, photos, food photography, detailed ingredients, busy patterns, harsh neon, 3D realism, complex textures.
