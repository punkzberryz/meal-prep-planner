# Plans Hygiene

## Overview

Use this skill whenever roadmap items are added, removed, or completed so `docs/PLANS.md` stays accurate.

## Guidelines

1. Update `docs/PLANS.md` when scope changes
   - Move completed items to the Completed section.
   - Remove fulfilled items from the Near-Term roadmap.
   - Keep the Definition of Done aligned with current scope.
